\title{Analyze bed stability}
\usage{
bed_stability(gsd, stress, TC50 = 0.036, Map = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{gsd}{data frame containing GSD information (as per \code{simulate_gsd})}

\item{stress}{estimated mean boundary shear stress acting on the bed (Pa)}

\item{TC50}{(optional) critical dimensionless stress for D50 (default is 0.045)}

\item{Map}{(optional) LOGICAL, when TRUE, the distributions are graphed}
}
\description{
\code{bed_stability} is a function that takes the grain size distribution
data output from \code{simulate_gsd}, and an estimate of the mean boundary
shear stress to estimate the fraction of the bed that is stable, accounting
for partial mobility for stresses between 1 and 2 times the critical value.
Estimates of the stable proportion in each size class is added to the data
frame, as are estimates of the CDF. The total areal fraction of the bed that
is stable can be estimated by summing the variable p.stab in the output
dataframe.
